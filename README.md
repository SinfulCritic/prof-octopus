# Professor Octopus

Professor Octopus was created to supply a tool for students wishing to count the occurences of a word in a file before reading it(or to get out of reading it.)
This allows the student to get an overview of what areas the text touches, before reading it, and thus improving comprehension as the student now knows what to focus on.

Professor Octopus is still pre-alpha, and does not work in the slightest.
